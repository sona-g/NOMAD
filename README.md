# NOMAD- A hotel booking app
A MERN stack project using REST APIs and Stripe as payement gateway.

## Time Frame
1 week

## Description
It is set up with features suitable to be used by the User who can browse and book hotel for the preferred dates, and further complete booking using stripe. The user can also view his/her booking in teh booked section and view the payment reciept with the booking reference number.

The app is built to log in as a Seller too, who cannot make bookings but can post the hotel availability from his/her end for the selected dates and re-edit the details if needed. The seller must set up a Stripe payout account within the app to be allowed to post as a seller. 

## Highlights
* [x] Login using JWT
* [x] Redux for state management
* [x] Search using query-string and Autocomplete places api
* [x] Stripe to collect payments from user and make payouts to seller
* [x] Bootstrap and AntDesign frameworks

## Run the app
The app can run using 'npm start' for both the client and the server. 

## Summary
The project gave me a steep learning curve in integrating stripe for user and seller as well as on usind redux. 
On making a marketplace project like this one, it can adapt to any other marketplace business where the platform can charge its fee for providing the service.
